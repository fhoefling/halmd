// CUDA symbols (__constant__ or __device__ variables at module scope)
// in different translation units must not have the same name, therefore
// we need to compile all instantiations of mpc_kernel in the same
// translation unit.
//
// Although symbols are static to their translation unit, and symbols
// with the same name have different addresses, cudaMemcpyFromSymbol and
// cudaMemcpyToSymbol will *silently* fail to copy from or to the given
// symbol, as CUDA addresses a symbol by its mangled C++ name, not its
// address in memory.
