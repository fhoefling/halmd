 * Slot-to-signal connection
 *
 * This class manages the connection of a single slot to a signal
 * *independent* of the lifetime of the signal. We employ a weak
 * pointer to observe the shared pointer holding the slots in the
 * signal object.
 * A weak pointer is locked to retrieve a shared pointer to the
 * referenced object. If the weak pointer does not observe an
 * object, lock() will return an empty shared pointer instead.
 * This is the case if (1) we erase() the slot using the stored
 * iterator and reset() the weak pointer, (2) all slots are
 * disconnected from the signal with disconnect_all_slots()
 * by reallocating the slots list, or (3) the signal object
 * along with the slots list is deconstructed. Thus the state of
 * the weak pointer reflects the validity of the connection object.
