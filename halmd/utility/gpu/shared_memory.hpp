/**
 * Given the element type of a shared memory array, calculates the maximum
 * number of threads per block supported by the GPU architecture, as the
 * next-lower power of 2.
 *
 * This metafunction calculates the maximum number of threads by dividing
 * the maximum shared memory by the element size, and then rounding the
 * result down to the next-lower power of 2.
 *
 * Note that with PTX version 1.3 and older, kernel arguments are passed
 * via shared memory. To account for the decrease in available shared
 * memory, this metafunction substracts 1 from the maximum number of
 * threads before rounding to the next-lower power of 2.
 * As an example, if the unrounded number of threads is exactly 512,
 * subtracting 1 will yield a next-lower power of two of 256 threads.
 *
 * For PTX version 2.0 and higher, kernel arguments are passed
 * via constant memory, thus this correction is not necessary.
