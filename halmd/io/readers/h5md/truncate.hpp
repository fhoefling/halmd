 * H5MD dataset reader (truncate mode)

 * This module implements collective reading from one or multiple H5MD
 * datasets. Upon initialisation, the reader is assigned a collective
 * H5MD group. A dataset within this group is created by connecting a
 * data slot to the on_read signal.
 *
 * The reader provides a common read slot, which may be connected to
 * another module to read the datasets. Further signals on_prepend_read
 * and on_append_read are provided to call arbitrary slots before and
 * after reading.
