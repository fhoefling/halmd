 * datasets. Upon initialisation, the writer is assigned a collective
 * H5MD group. A dataset within this group is created by connecting a
 * data slot to the on_write signal.
 *
 * The writer provides a common write slot, which may be connected to
 * the sampler to write to the datasets at a fixed interval. Further
 * signals on_prepend_write and on_append_write are provided to call
 * arbitrary slots before and after writing.
