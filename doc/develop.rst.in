HALMD Development
=================

If you want to contribute to the HALMD development, there are several ways to do that:
 * The source code is available on `GitHub <http://github.com/fhoefling/halmd>`_
 * Patches can be submitted and discussed via our
   `mailing list <http://lists.halmd.org/listinfo/halmd-devel>`_ (a GitHub pull
   request is fine, too).
 * Bugs can be reported and viewed on
   `Redmine <http://www.hostedredmine.com/projects/halmd>`_. There is also a rough
   roadmap available that gives you an overview about what is planned in the next releases.
 * Automatic test results can be viewed on the `CDash Dashboard <http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=HALMD>`_.
   If you want to contribute to the :ref:`test suite <testing>` with your own setup,
   get in contact with us and we can provide you the necessary information.

If you want to know about more about the development of HALMD, you may continue
