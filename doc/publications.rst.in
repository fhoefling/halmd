Scientific research
===================

**Liquid flow in amorphous nanopores**

    The fluid flow in nanopores depends on the interaction with the pore
    surfaces, but also on their atomic-scale morphology.  Matching the
    molecular structures of pore walls and fluid minimises the surface slip,
    with crystalline and amorphous walls producing distinct flow resistances.
    Thus, surface morphology offers a means to control surface slip in
    non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations and emphasize the
    need for molecular-scale models to accurately capture fluid dynamics in
    nanoporous materials.

**Adaptive resolution simulation of open systems out of equilibrium**

    The Adaptive Resolution Simulation (AdResS) technique permits molecular
    dynamics simulations with open boundaries by a transparent coupling to
    particle reservoirs. Translating the theoretical model of Bergmann and
    Lebowitz for open systems out of equilibrium to AdResS yields NEMD
    simulations of the unconstrained (NVE) dynamics of fluids with open
    boundaries in a thermal gradient. A pressure gradient with an ensuing mass
    flux is maintained if a permeable mebrane is used to resist the fluid flow.
    Thermal isolation of the fluid and viscous dissipation cause a rise in
    fluid temperature, consistent with fluid mechanics.

**Frequency-dependent transport coefficients in viscous liquids**

    How friction in liquids emerges from conservative forces between atoms is a
    crucial parameter for dynamic processes in liquid matter and soft
    materials. Using energy-conserving molecular dynamics simulations of simple
    and complex liquids, frequency-resolved coefficients of molecular friction
    and shear viscosity are obtained from high-precision data for response
    functions, covering several decades in time. This approach bridges
    hydrodynamic long-time anomalies and a frictionless high-frequency regime.
    Combining simulation data with theory shows that the friction felt by a
    single molecule occurs abruptly below a certain frequency.

    atomistic and hydrodynamic pictures,

**Critical dynamics and surface adsorption of symmetric binary fluids**

    Binary liquids phase separate at certain thermodynamic conditions.
    Continous demixing transitions occur along the so-called λ-line, where
    critical opalescence, long-ranged correlations, and scaling behaviour are
    observed. Confinement of the mixture to a slit pore leads to surface
    enrichment of one component with corresponding adsorption profiles
    exhibiting critical scaling. Diverging length and time scales challenge the
    simulation of these phenomena and require substantial computational
    resources. For a family of binary Lennard-Jones liquids, the partial
    structure factors, mutual or inter-diffusion constants and the shear
    viscosity were obtained in molecular dynamics simulations.

**Cavitation in glass-like, amorphous solids**

    Continous expansion of a dense, amorphous solid leads to the formation of
    cavities and, eventually, failure. The picture depicts long-lived bubbles,
    which exist near the thermodynamic coexistence of gas phase (yellow) and
    glassy state (green). The study is based on extensive molecular dynamics
    simulations for system sizes of up to one million particles over long time
    spans.

**Adsorption kinetics of methane in metal-organic frameworks**

    The high porosity and large surface area of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)
    makes them interesting for technical applications. In contact with gaseous
    methane (CH₄), one observes that the methane condenses in and around the
    MOF already for unusually low gas pressure. Molecular dynamics simulations
    give insight into the kinetics of the adsorption process into a single
    grain of IRMOF-1.

**Mesoscopic structure of liquid–vapour interfaces**

    At the molecular scale, liquid–vapour interfaces are broadened and
    roughened by thermally excited capillary waves. These fluctuations give
    rise to a divergence of the interfacial structure factor at small
    wave-numbers; the latter being accessible to grazing-incidence small-angle
    X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments. The paper discusses deviations from
    the classical theory and relies on extensive simulations of planar interfaces
    using up to 445,000 Lennard-Jones particles. GISAXS intensities are
    computed on the fly of the simulations.
