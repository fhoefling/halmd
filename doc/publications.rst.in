Scientific research
===================

**Mesoscopic structure of liquid–vapour interfaces**
    At the molecular scale, liquid–vapour interfaces are broadened and
    roughened by thermally excited capillary waves. These fluctuations give
    rise to a divergence of the interfacial structure factor at small
    wave-numbers; the latter being accessible to grazing-incidence small-angle
    X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments. The paper discusses deviations from
    the classical theory and relies on extensive simulations of planar interfaces
    using up to 445,000 Lennard-Jones particles. GISAXS intensities are
    computed on the fly of the simulations.
