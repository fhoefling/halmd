  This XSLT stylesheet transforms the XML output of Doxygen to reStructuredText,

  based on the reference.xsl stylesheet of the Boost.Asio library, which was
  written by Christopher M. Kohlhoff to generate documentation in Quickbook.

  Please see the documentation on XSL Transformations [1] and XPath [2] to learn
  about the syntax and semantics of the language. In addition, we make use of
  EXSLT [3], a collection of useful extensions to XSLT 1.0 which is supported by
  many XSLT processors, e.g. xsltproc or saxon.
