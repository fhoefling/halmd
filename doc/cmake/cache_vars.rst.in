Useful CMake cache variables
----------------------------

Cache variables are passed as options to CMake using ``-D...``

.. glossary::

   CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
     CMake build type.

     For production builds with -O3 optimisation enabled,
     use ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release``.

     For debugging builds with -O2 optimisation and debug symbols enabled,
     use ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo``.

     For builds using CUDA device emulation,
     use ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DeviceEmu``.

   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
     Path to third-party libraries, e.g. ``-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/usr``.

     This variable is only needed if libraries are installed in non-standard paths.

   HALMD_USE_STATIC_LIBS
     Compile separate, statically linked executable for each backend.

     This flag does not apply to the CUDA runtime library. To use the CUDA runtime
     statically see CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME.

   Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS
     Link to Boost libraries statically.

     Recommended value is ``-DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=TRUE``.

   HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBS
     Link to HDF5 libraries statically.

     Recommended value is ``-DHDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBS=TRUE``.

   LUA_USE_STATIC_LIBS
     Link to Lua libraries statically.

     Recommended value is ``-DLUA_USE_STATIC_LIBS=TRUE``.

   CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME
     Link to the CUDA runtime library statically.

     Note, that linking statically could lead to kernel launch failures
     when using CUDA 9.2.

   HALMD_WITH_GPU

     Forcibly enable or disable GPU support.

     By default, GPU support is enabled or disabled depending on whether CUDA
     is available. If HALMD_WITH_GPU is explicitly set to TRUE, CMake will
     fail if CUDA is not available. If HALMD_WITH_GPU is explicitly set to
     FALSE, GPU support will be disabled even if CUDA is available.

   HALMD_POTENTIALS

     Semicolon-separated list of potential modules that shall be instantiated.
     By default, all available potentials are enabled.

   HALMD_VARIANT_FORCE_DSFUN
     Use double-single precision functions in force summation (GPU backend only).

     Default value is ``TRUE``.

   HALMD_VARIANT_HILBERT_ALT_3D
     Use alternative vertex rules for the 3D Hilbert curve used for particle
     ordering (GPU backend only).

     Default value is ``FALSE``.

   HALMD_VARIANT_HOST_SINGLE_PRECISION
     Use single-precision math in host implementation (host backend only).

     Default value is ``FALSE``.

     This option requires SSE, which is enabled by default on x86_64.

   HALMD_VARIANT_VERLET_DSFUN
     Use double-single precision functions in Verlet integrator (GPU backend only).

     Default value is ``TRUE``.
