Prerequisites
=============

This section is a step-by-step guide to installing the necessary dependencies to
compile HALMD from source. Be sure to check if your distribution ships with any
of these packages before attempting to compile them yourself.

.. tip::

   When installing third-party packages, it is advisable to put them into
   separate directories. If you install software only for yourself, use package
   directories of the form ``~/usr/PKGNAME-PKGVERSION``, for example
   ``~/usr/boost-1.44.0`` or ``~/usr/Sphinx-1.0.4``. If you install software
   system-wide as the root user, use ``/opt/PKGNAME-PKGVERSION``.
   This simple scheme allows you to have multiple versions of a package, or
   remove a package without impacting others.
