Introduction
************

*HAL’s MD package* is a high-precision molecular dynamics framework for the
simulation of complex dynamic phenomena in materials research, in a broad
sense, with a focus on nanofluidics and soft matter.  The software has been
specifically designed for acceleration through `CUDA
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA>`_-enabled graphics processors, with an
emphasis on both high performance and numerical long-time stability. It shows
very good scalability from few thousands to millions of particles.

*HAL’s MD package* is maintained and developed by `Felix Höfling
<http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/hoefling>`_ and was initially written together
with `Peter Colberg. <https://www.linkedin.com/in/petercolberg>`_
Special credit goes to `Nicolas Höft <https://www.starlabs.de>`_ and
`Daniel Kirchner <https://github.com/ekpyron>`_
for their manifold contributions.


.. note::

   A description of the implementation, performance tests, numerical stability
   tests, and an application to slow glassy dynamics can be found in the
   article by P. H. Colberg and F. Höfling, `Highly accelerated simulations of
   glassy dynamics using GPUs: Caveats on limited floating-point precision

Physics applications
====================

*HAL’s MD package* was made to study

* the spatio-temporal dynamics of inhomogeneous and complex liquids

* glass transition, liquid–vapour interfaces, phase separation of binary fluids,
  confined fluids, porous media, … (active matter coming soon)

* particles interacting via many truncated and untruncated :ref:`potentials
  <potentials>` of the external and pair type (anisotropic and bonded potentials coming soon)

* microcanonical (NVE) and canonical (NVT) ensembles with Hamiltonian and Brownian dynamics  (:ref:`integrators`, optimised multi-stage integrators coming soon)

* both two- and three-dimensional systems, natively

* with periodic, closed and open boundaries

Science using *HAL's MD package* is highlighted in the :ref:`publication gallery <publications>`.


Features
========

*HAL’s MD package* features

* GPU acceleration: 1 NVIDIA A40 GPU shows 200-300 fold speed-up over a single Xeon CPU core
  (:ref:`benchmarks`)

* high performance and excellent numerical long-time stability (e.g., energy
  conservation)

* user scripts, which define complex simulation protocols

* online evaluation of :ref:`observables <observables>` including dynamic
  correlation functions

* structured, compressed, and portable `H5MD <http://nongnu.org/h5md>`_ output
  files

* extensibility by the generic and modular design


Technical features
------------------

*HAL’s MD package* brings

* an extensive automatic test suite using `CMake <http://cmake.org>`_

* double-single floating-point precision for numerically critical hot spots

* :ref:`C²-smooth potential cutoffs <smooth_r4>` for improved energy conservation

* an integrated, lightweight `Lua <http://lua.org>`_ interpreter

* modern, template-based C++ code taking advantage of `C++14 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++14>`_


Licence
=======

*HAL's MD package* is free software, developed and distributed under the
`LGPL-3+ licence <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt>`_. Please
reference the technical papers listed in section `Publications <publications>`_
and the website URL `<https://halmd.org>`_ in scientific publications based on

Historical footnote
===================

The name *HAL’s MD package* was chosen in honour of the machine `HAL
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000>`_ at the Arnold Sommerfeld Center for
Theoretical Physics of the Ludwigs-Maximilians-Universität München. HAL has
been the project’s first GPGPU machine in 2007, equipped initially with two
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra. HAL survived a critical air condition failure in the
server room.
