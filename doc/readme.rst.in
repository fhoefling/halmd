Introduction
************

*HAL’s MD package* is a high-precision molecular dynamics package for
large-scale simulations of the complex dynamics in inhomogeneous liquids. It
has been specifically designed to support acceleration through `CUDA
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA>`_-enabled graphics processors.

*HAL’s MD package* is maintained and developed by `Felix Höfling
<http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/hoefling>`_ and was initially written together
with Peter Colberg. Special credits go to `Nicolas Höft
<https://www.starlabs.de>`_ and `Daniel Kirchner
<https://de.linkedin.com/in/daniel-kirchner-6024b375>`_ for their manifold
contributions.

.. note::

   A description of the implementation, performance tests, numerical stability
   tests, and an application to slow glassy dynamics can be found in the
   article by P. H. Colberg and F. Höfling, `Highly accelerated simulations of
   glassy dynamics using GPUs: Caveats on limited floating-point precision
   <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2011.01.009>`_, Comput. Phys. Commun.

Physics applications
====================

*HAL’s MD package* is designed to study

* the spatio-temporal dynamics of inhomogeneous and complex liquids

* both two- and three-dimensional systems

* particles interacting via many truncated and untruncated pair
  :ref:`potentials <potentials>` (bonded and external potentials coming soon)

* microcanonical (NVE) and canonical (NVT) ensembles (:ref:`integrators`)

* glass transition, liquid–vapour interfaces, demixing of binary fluids,
  confined fluids, porous media, …


Features
========

*HAL’s MD package* features

* GPU-acceleration: 1 NVIDIA Kepler K20Xm GPU comparable to 100 CPU cores
  (:ref:`benchmarks`)

* high performance and excellent numerical long-time stability (e.g., energy
  conservation)

* user scripts, which define complex simulation protocols

* online evaluation of :ref:`observables <observables>` including dynamic correlation functions

* structured, compressed, and portable `H5MD <http://nongnu.org/h5md>`_
  output files

* extensibility by the generic and modular design

* free software under LGPL-3+ license


Technical features
------------------

*HAL’s MD package* brings

* an extensive automatic test suite using `CMake <http://cmake.org>`_

* double-single floating-point precision for numerically critical hot spots

* :ref:`C²-smooth potential cutoffs <smooth_r4>` for improved energy conservation

* an integrated, lightweight `Lua <http://lua.org>`_ interpreter

* template-based C++ code taking advantage of `C++11 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11>`_


Historical footnote
===================

The name *HAL’s MD package* was chosen in honour of the machine `HAL
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000>`_ at the Arnold Sommerfeld Center for
Theoretical Physics of the Ludwigs-Maximilians-Universität München. HAL has
been the project’s first GPGPU machine in 2007, equipped initially with two
NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra. HAL survived a critical air condition failure in the
server room.
