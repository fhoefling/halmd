Test suite
**********

Structure
=========

The test suite is divided into the following components.

.. rubric:: test/integration

Integration tests. These tests run HALMD for a given set of command-line
parameters or Lua input script, and verify the obtained results. The test
execution is done with CMake scripts, the result verification with
Boost Test.

.. rubric:: test/lua

Lua unit tests. Unit tests of pure Lua components.

.. rubric:: test/performance

Performance tests of individual HALMD components or the HALMD executable.

.. rubric:: test/tools

Testing tools, e.g. test fixtures used in multiple tests.

.. rubric:: test/unit

C++ unit tests. These minimal tests verify individual HALMD components.

Naming conventions
==================

* Set **BOOST_TEST_MODULE** to the basename of the test source file ::

    #define BOOST_TEST_MODULE lattice

* Use full path (with “test”) to the test in the **executable name** ::

    add_executable(test_unit_mdsim_positions_lattice
        lattice.cpp
    )

* Use full path (without “test”) to the test in the **CMake test name** ::

    add_test(unit/mdsim/positions/lattice
        test_unit_mdsim_positions_lattice --log_level=test_suite
    )
