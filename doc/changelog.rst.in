Version 0.2.0
=============

Version 0.2.0 is a complete rewrite of branch 0.1.x, aiming at a modular code
base. Most algorithms, in particular the actual MD simulation algorithms, have
been kept.

This version features a slightly larger choice of potentials and NVT
integrators, but it brings only rudimentary support for dynamic correlations
functions.
