Version 0.3.0
=============

**New features**

* potentials: local, smooth cutoff for continuously differentiable forces
  <Nicolas Höft>

* potentials: Lennard-Jones potential with shifted force ("linear cutoff")
  <Felix Höfling>

* observables: computation of full stress tensor <Felix Höfling>

* observables: density profiles (along a Cartesian axis) and d-dimensional
  density fields <Felix Höfling>

* observables: scattered intensity in grazing-incidence diffraction (GID)
  experiments <Felix Höfling>

* simulation setup: fill slab of initial lattice with a fraction of particles
  only and distribute the rest at lattices around that slab <Felix Höfling>

* FIXME Rotne-Prager tensor <Michael Kopp>

**Bug fixes**

* properly handle a sampling interval of zero (disable sampling)
  <Felix Höfling>

* static structure factor: reset internal accumulators after call to sample()
  <Felix Höfling>


Version 0.2.1
=============

**Improvements**

* improve performance of force kernel for truncated pair interactions by about
  10% due to inefficient use of the texture cache

**Bug fixes**

* fix regex benchmark scripts

* fix build failure with Boost C++ 1.53.0

* fix build failure with nvcc option -arch=sm_20 and CMake switch
  VERLET_DSFUN=FALSE


Version 0.2.0
=============

Version 0.2.0 is a complete rewrite of branch 0.1.x, aiming at a modular code
base. Most algorithms, in particular the actual MD simulation algorithms, have
been kept.

This version features a slightly larger choice of potentials and NVT
integrators, but it brings only rudimentary support for dynamic correlations
functions.


Version 0.1.2
=============

**Improvements**

* fully support mobility filters for the VACF


Version 0.1.2
=============

**Improvements**

* revise documentation

**Bug fixes**

* fix build failure with Boost C++ 1.46


Version 0.1.1
=============

**New features**

* computation of shear viscosity

* displacement/mobility filters for dynamic correlation functions

**Bug fixes**

* fix build failure with CUDA 3.2

* fix build failure with Boost C++ 1.42


Version 0.1.0
=============

The first release of HAL's MD package, forming the basis for the preprint at
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3824, later published in Comput. Phys. Commun.
**182**, 1120 (2011).
