Changelog
*********

Version 0.2.1
=============

**Improvements**

* improve performance of force kernel for truncated pair interactions by about
  10% due to inefficient use of the texture cache

**Bug fixes**

* fix regex benchmark scripts

* fix build failure with Boost C++ 1.53.0

* fix build failure with nvcc option -arch=sm_20 and CMake switch
  VERLET_DSFUN=FALSE


Version 0.2.0
=============

Version 0.2.0 is a complete rewrite of branch 0.1.x, aiming at a modular code
base. Most algorithms, in particular the actual MD simulation algorithms, have
been kept.

This version features a slightly larger choice of potentials and NVT
integrators, but it brings only rudimentary support for dynamic correlations
functions.

Version 0.1.2
=============

**Improvements**

* fully support mobility filters for the VACF

Version 0.1.2
=============

**Improvements**

* revise documentation

**Bug fixes**

* fix build failure with Boost C++ 1.46

Version 0.1.1
=============

**New features**

* computation of shear viscosity

* displacement/mobility filters for dynamic correlation functions

**Bug fixes**

* fix build failure with CUDA 3.2

* fix build failure with Boost C++ 1.42

Version 0.1.0
=============

The first release of HAL's MD package, forming the basis for the preprint at
http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3824, later published in Comput. Phys. Commun.
**182**, 1120 (2011).
