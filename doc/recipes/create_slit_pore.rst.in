Create fluid in a slit pore
===========================

A fluid confined to a slit pore is set up by placing fluid particles in between
two planar surfaces. The latter are implemented as flat walls by an
:mod:`external wall potential <halmd.mdsim.potentials.external.planar_wall>`.
The fluid may consist of particles of different species, and the walls may have
different interaction parameters for each species. For simplicity, only a
single species is used here.

.. note::

    The simulation box is still defined with periodic boundary conditions at
    all its faces. Therefore, it is crucial that the box size in the direction
    perpendicular to the walls is larger than the pore width to avoid spurious
    pair interactions across the walls.

The setup procedure has the following steps:

 * define geometry: pore width and box extents, fraction of the pore
 * place particles on an fcc lattice in the pore part of the box
 * assign random velocities according to a Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution
 * define interactions: pair potential, external wall potential
