Create initial state of a fluid mixture
=======================================

For fluid mixtures, which have the same interaction laws for each component
(but different coefficients), all fluid particles are collected in a single
instance of :mod:`particle <halmd.mdsim.particle>`. The different components
are distinguished by their value for ``species``, particles of the same species
form a contiguous range in ``tag`` (which is given by the index in the particle
array). This allows for the efficient selection of each component from a
:mod:`range of tags <halmd.mdsim.particle_groups.id_range>`.

The setup procedure has the following steps:

 * create system state
 * sequentially assign particle species
 * sequentially place particles on an fcc lattice
 * randomly shuffle the positions
 * assign random velocities according to a Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution

   :lines: 3-35
   :language: lua

.. note::

    The approach to randomly shuffle the particle positions is not very
    efficient performance-wise: in the current implementation, it involves 6
    deep copies of the position array (assuming that the GPU is the compute
    device).
