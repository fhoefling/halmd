**Why does HALMD abort with “[ERROR] overcrowded placeholders in cell/neighbour lists update”?**
  The GPU backends of HALMD employ fixed-size cell and neighbour lists to
  accommodate for memory access pattern constraints.
  By default, a cell or neighbour list is allocated twice as many placeholders
  as the average expected number of particles. This may not suffice in case
  of large local density fluctuations, e.g. for unequilibrated systems.

  Try lowering the ``--cell-occupancy`` value.

**Why does HALMD abort with “[ERROR] potential energy diverged”?**
  An infinite potential energy sum of one or more particles indicates that the
  integration time-step is too large.

  Try lowering the ``--timestep`` value.

**nvcc fails with 'cudafe++' died due to signal 11 (Invalid memory reference)**
  This is due to a bug in the CUDA compiler, which may be circumvented by
  including ``--host-compilation=c`` in the ``NVCCFLAGS`` environment variable
  passed to cmake, or in CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS using ccmake.
