**Why does ljgpu abort with “[ERROR] overcrowded placeholders in cell/neighbour lists update”?**
  The GPU backends of ljgpu employ fixed-size cell and neighbour lists to
  accommodate for memory access pattern constraints.
  By default, a cell or neighbour list is allocated twice as many placeholders
  as the average expected number of particles. This may not suffice in case
  of large local density fluctuations, e.g. for unequilibrated systems.

  Try lowering the ``--cell-occupancy`` value.

**Why does ljgpu abort with “[ERROR] potential energy diverged”?**
  An infinite potential energy sum of one or more particles indicates that the
  integration time-step is too large.

  Try lowering the ``--timestep`` value.
