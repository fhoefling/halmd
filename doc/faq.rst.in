**Thanks to *HAL’s MD package* I could do simulations of breath-taking quality
and have obtained new scientific insight. How shall I give credit to your work?**

  Please acknowledge the use of *HAL’s MD package* in your publications by
  citing our article:

   P. H. Colberg and F. Höfling, *Highly accelerated simulations of glassy
   dynamics using GPUs: Caveats on limited floating-point precision,* `Comput.
   Phys. Commun. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2011.01.009>`_ **182**, 1120
   (2011).

**Why does HALMD abort with “[ERROR] potential energy diverged”?**

  An infinite potential energy sum of one or more particles indicates that the
  integration time-step is too large.

  Try lowering the ``--timestep`` value.

**Linking fails with: undefined reference to
`boost::filesystem3::detail::copy_file(...)'**

  Check that the ABI version of the installed Boost C++ library conforms to
  C++11. This can be achieved by building Boost C++ with the GCC option
  ``--std=c++11``.
