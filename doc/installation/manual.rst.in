Manual installation
===================

This section is a step-by-step guide for manual installation of the required
build dependencies of HALMD. Be sure to check if your distribution ships with
any of these packages before attempting to compile them yourself. Before
proceeding, be aware of the section :ref:`automatic`.

.. tip::

   When installing third-party packages, it is advisable to put them into
   separate directories. If you install software only for yourself, use package
   directories of the form ``~/opt/PKGNAME-PKGVERSION``, for example
   ``~/opt/boost-1.57.0`` or ``~/opt/Sphinx-1.2.3``. If you install software
   system-wide as the root user, use ``/opt/PKGNAME-PKGVERSION``.
   This simple scheme allows you to have multiple versions of a package, or
   remove a package without impacting others.

When initially creating the CMake build tree, include all third-party package
directories in the environment variable ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``.
For example, if Boost and Lua are installed in your home directory,
CUDA is installed system-wide, and the HALMD source is in ``~/projects/halmd``,
the initial cmake command might look like this ::

   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/opt/boost_1_57_0:/opt/cuda-5.5:~/opt/lua-5.2.3 cmake ~/projects/halmd

Instead of setting CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH manually, you would include the package directories in your ~/.bashrc (or your favourite shellâ€™s equivalent) ::

   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${HOME}/opt/boost_1_57_0${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH+:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/cuda-5.5${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH+:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${HOME}/opt/lua-5.2.3${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH+:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"

GNU/Linux
---------

CMake
^^^^^

The build process of HALMD depends on `CMake`_, a cross-platform, open-source build system.

Get the latest `CMake-CUDA`_, currently `CMake-CUDA 2.8.12.2`_.

.. _CMake: http://www.cmake.org

.. _CMake-CUDA: https://github.com/halmd-org/cmake-cuda

.. _CMake-CUDA 2.8.12.2: https://github.com/halmd-org/cmake-cuda/archive/2.8.12.2-cuda.tar.gz

Extract the CMake-CUDA source package, and prepare the CMake build with ::

   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/cmake-cuda

Compile CMake with ::

   make

Install CMake into your packages directory::

   make install

Include CMake in your shell environment, by adding to ~/.bashrc::

   export PATH="${HOME}/opt/cmake-cuda/bin${PATH+:$PATH}"
   export MANPATH="${HOME}/opt/cmake-cuda/man${MANPATH+:$MANPATH}"


Boost C++ libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the latest `Boost source package`_, currently `Boost 1.57.0`_ (1.55.0
is the minimum required version).

.. _Boost source package: http://www.boost.org/users/download
.. _Boost 1.57.0: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.57.0/boost_1_57_0.tar.bz2

To build Boost, extract the source package and bootstrap the build with ::

   ./bootstrap.sh

Compile Boost using ::

   ./bjam cxxflags="-fPIC -std=c++11"

This compiles both dynamic and static libraries.

.. note:: By default, CMake uses the dynamically linked Boost libraries.

   This is the recommended way of linking to Boost, as static linking of
   the unit test executables significantly increases the size of the build
   tree. If you wish to link statically nevertheless, for example to run a
   program on another machine without your Boost libraries, invoke cmake
   with ``-DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=True`` on the *first* run.

.. warning:: Boost may require more than fifteen minutes to compile.

   You are strongly advised to take a coffee break.

Install the Boost libraries into your packages directory::

   ./bjam cxxflags="-fPIC -std=c++11" install --prefix=$HOME/opt/boost_1_57_0

Include Boost in your shell environment, by adding to ~/.bashrc::

   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${HOME}/opt/boost_1_57_0${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH+:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${HOME}/opt/boost_1_57_0/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"


Lua interpreter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the latest Lua source package from the `Lua download`_ page, currently `Lua 5.2.3`_.

.. _Lua download: http://www.lua.org/download.html
.. _Lua 5.2.3: http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.2.3.tar.gz

Extract the Lua source package.

The recommended way of embedding the Lua intepreter in an executable is to link
the Lua library statically, which is the default mode of compilation.

On **32-bit platforms**, compile the Lua library with ::

   make linux

On **64-bit platforms**, include the ``-fPIC`` flag using ::

   make linux CFLAGS="-DLUA_USE_LINUX -fPIC -O2 -Wall"

Install the Lua library into your packages directory::

   make install INSTALL_TOP=~/opt/lua-5.2.3

Include Lua in your shell environment, by adding to ~/.bashrc::

   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${HOME}/opt/lua-5.2.3${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH+:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"
   export PATH="${HOME}/opt/lua-5.2.3/bin${PATH+:$PATH}"
   export MANPATH="${HOME}/opt/lua-5.2.3/man${MANPATH+:$MANPATH}"


HDF5 library
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the latest `HDF5 source package`_, currently `HDF5 1.8.14`_.

.. _HDF5 source package: http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html#obtain
.. _HDF5 1.8.14: http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/hdf5-1.8.14.tar.gz

Prepare a statically linked build of the HDF5 C and C++ library with ::

   CFLAGS=-fPIC CXXFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --enable-cxx --enable-static --prefix=$HOME/opt/hdf5-1.8.14

.. note:: Compiling HDF5 with C++ support disables multi-threading.

Compile HDF5 using ::

   make

Install the HDF5 libraries into your packages directory::

   make install

Include HDF5 in your shell environment, by adding to ~/.bashrc::

   export PATH="${HOME}/opt/hdf5-1.8.14/bin${PATH+:$PATH}"
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${HOME}/opt/hdf5-1.8.14${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH+:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}"


Sphinx documentation generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Get the latest `Sphinx source package`_, currently `Sphinx 1.2.3`_.

.. _Sphinx source package: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx
.. _Sphinx 1.2.3: http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/S/Sphinx/Sphinx-1.2.3.tar.gz

Query your Python version ::

   python -V

Create a package directory for Sphinx using the Python major and minor version (here 2.7) ::

   mkdir -p $HOME/opt/Sphinx-1.2.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages

Add the package directory to the PYTHON_PATH environment variable ::

   export PYTHONPATH="${HOME}/opt/Sphinx-1.2.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages${PYTHONPATH+:$PYTHONPATH}"

Install Sphinx into your packages directory ::

   python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/opt/Sphinx-1.2.3

Include Sphinx in your shell environment, by adding to ~/.bashrc::

   export PATH="${HOME}/opt/Sphinx-1.2.3/bin${PATH+:$PATH}"
   export PYTHONPATH="${HOME}/opt/Sphinx-1.2.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages${PYTHONPATH+:$PYTHONPATH}"
