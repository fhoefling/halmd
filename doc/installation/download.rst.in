Downloading the source code
***************************

Cloning the repository
======================

HALMD is maintained in a public `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ repository ::

  git clone --recursive http://git.halmd.org/halmd.git

which is redirected to `GitHub <http://github.com>`_. If you prefer the git
protocol use ::

  git clone --recursive git://github.com/fhoefling/halmd.git

This will create a directory ``halmd``, which holds a hidden copy of the
repository and a working copy of the source files.


Selecting a release version
===========================

By default, the above command yields the tip of the development branch.
A specific release version is checked out by ::

  git checkout TAG

where ``TAG`` is a valid release tag as listed from ::

  git tag -n3
