Building HAL's MD package
*************************

Compilation and Installation
============================

HALMD uses `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ to generate its make files, which is
similar to the more commonly used Autotools suite recognisable by the
``configure`` script accompanying a software package, but much faster and much
easier to develop with.

With cmake, out-of-tree compilation is preferred, so we generate the compilation
or build tree in a separate directory. This allows one to have multiple builds
of the same software at the same time, for example a release build with
aggressive optimisation and a debug build including debugging symbols. Note that
the build directory may be a subdirectory in the source tree.

Setting up the build tree
-------------------------

In the cloned HALMD repository, switch to a new build directory::

  mkdir -p build/release && cd build/release

If the third-party packages are installed in standard locations, run ::

  cmake ../..

This will detect all necessary software, and then generate the make files. If
third-party packages are not found in standard locations, make sure to
correctly set the environment variable ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, see
:ref:`prerequisites`.

Compilation
-----------

Compilation is done using make, which supports parallel builds::

  nice make -j4

The default installation directory is ``/usr/local``, which may be adjusted by invoking ::

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/opt/halmd-version ../..

For compilation and subsequent installation type::

  nice make -j4 install


Further CMake configuration
---------------------------

Compilation flags may be configured via CMake's text mode interface::

  ccmake .

To finish configuration, hit "c" and "g" to apply and recompile with make.
Alternatively, you may use CMake's graphical interface::

  cmake-gui .

The following switch displays the actual commands invoked by make::

  CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE	ON

An installation prefix may be specified as following::

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX		/your/home/directory/usr

The compiled program is then installed into this tree by ::

  nice make -j4 install


Updating the build tree
-----------------------

After checking out to a different version (or more recent Git commit), **switch
to the build directory** (e.g., ``build/release``) and run::

  cmake .

This instructs CMake to regenerate the build tree using the configuration from the
previous run of CMake. Then compile with ``make`` as usual.


Setting build parameters
------------------------

Parameters may be passed to cmake as environment variables or cache variables.

Environment variables are prepended to the cmake command::

  CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -Wall" cmake ../..

:doc:`/cmake/env_vars`

Cache variables are appended using the -D option::

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..

:doc:`/cmake/cache_vars`

The following example demonstrates how to compile separate, dynamically linked
executables for each backend, which are statically linked to all libraries except the
standard C and C++ libraries::

  CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -Wall"
  NVCCFLAGS="-Xcompiler -fPIC -Xptxas -v -arch sm_12" \
  cmake \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      ../..

The options given here correspond to the default values.


Testing
=======

HALMD includes an extensive, preliminary test suite, which may be started in
the build tree by ::

  ctest
