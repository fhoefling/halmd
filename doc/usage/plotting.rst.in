Plotting the results
====================

Convenient and powerful access to the HDF5 output files is provided by the
Python packages `h5py <http://www.h5py.org>`_ together with
`PyLab <http://www.scipy.org/PyLab>`_. An examplary Python script for
accessing, post-processing and plotting the output data of HALMD is provided in
the sources at ``examples/plotting/plot_h5md.py``; it requires H5Py â‰¥ 2.0.1.

The various aspects of the script are detailed in the following. It starts with
loading some packages, defining command line options, and opening the HDF5
output file.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/plot_h5md.py
  :lines: 23-45

The script shows how to extract some of the simulation parameters that are
stored along with each HDF5 output file.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/plot_h5md.py
  :lines: 47-53

It illustrates how to computes the average temperature, pressure, and potential
energy over the whole simulation run or just over a selected range of data
points, i.e., a time window.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/plot_h5md.py
  :lines: 55-61

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/plot_h5md.py
  :pyobject: compute_average

Eventually, the script can dump the fluctuating potential energy as function of
time to a text file

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/plot_h5md.py
  :lines: 63-73

or directly generate a figure from these data

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/plot_h5md.py
  :lines: 75-90
