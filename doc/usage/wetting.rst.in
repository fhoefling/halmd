Tutorial: wetting processes at a flat, smooth interface
=======================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

You need a proper installation of *HALâ€™s MD package* and, for the analysis
part, Python with the `h5py <http://www.h5py.org>`_ package. The HDF5 tools
(e.g., ``h5ls``) are not required, but of advantage.

These simulation scripts are found in the folder
``/share/doc/halmd/examples`` relative to the installation path:

  - wetting/potential.lua
  - wetting/wetting_equilibration.lua
  - wetting/wetting_production.lua
  - plotting/density_profile.py
  - plotting/plot_density_profile.py


Setup
-----

The fluid is confined within a slit pore comprised of two identical planar walls
separated by a distance :math:`D=30\sigma` along the x-direction of the simulation
box, where :math:`\sigma` is the interaction range of the Lennard-Jones (LJ)
potential. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the directions parallel to
the planar walls.

The wetting behaviour of a LJ fluid is simulated using the smoothed truncated LJ potential
for particle-particle interactions and the planar wall potential for particle-wall interactions.
The simulation parameters for wetting processes are selected based on chemical physics literature [1]_.


Equilibration phase
-------------------

Melting of the initial lattice configuration with an NVT simulation:

.. code:: bash

    halmd wetting_equilibration.lua -v \
        --output wetting_thermalisation \
        --density 0.75 \
        --wetting 6.0 \
        --pore-width 30 \
        --temperature 0.9 \
        --time 500 \
        --sampling trajectory=1000


Production phase
----------------

The same script is then used for production, with all sampling turned on::

    halmd wetting_production.lua -v \
        --output wetting_production \
        --input wetting_thermalisation.h5 \
        --wetting 6.0 \
        --pore-width 30 \
        --time 1000 \
        --sampling trajectory=1000 structure=1000


Analysis of density profiles
----------------------------

The density profile can be obtained from the data on the wavevectors
compatible with the reciprocal space of the periodic simulation box
and the particles' positions.  The Python script provided at
``plotting/density_profile.py`` extracts this data from the output file
``wetting_product.h5`` generated during the production phase to compute
the 1D density profile. Another Python script, ``plotting/plot_density_profile.py``,
is employed to visualise the computed profile. An example call of the latter script is::

    python plot_density_profile.py --inputs wetting_production.h5

The calculation of the 1D density profile in ``plotting/density_profile.py``
involves the following steps:

Firstly, the complex Fourier modes are computed from the wavevectors and particle positions
along the x-direction (``coord_index=0``).

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/density_profile.py
  :lines: 29-41

Next, the wavevectors are transformed to the corresponding grid indices of the simulation
box in real space.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/density_profile.py
  :lines: 44-70

In the ``compute_1D_density`` function, inverse Fourier transformation is applied on
the modes to obtain the density. Due to symmetry, the density at the two ends
of the pore slit is set to be equal. The function returns the normalised density
with respect to bulk density and the position grid.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/plotting/density_profile.py
  :lines: 44-70

To observe the normalised density profiles at vapour liquid coexistence for various
wetting parameters :math:`w`, one should first execute the two Lua simulation scripts
(``wetting/wetting_equilibration.lua`` and ``wetting/wetting_production.lua``)
for :math:`w \in \{0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0\}`. Once the output files are obtained,
the profiles can be visualised in a single plot by running the following command::

    python plot_density_profile.py --inputs wetting_production_*.h5

.. image:: /_images/density_profiles.png

        :align: center
        :width: 75%
